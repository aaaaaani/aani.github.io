# Geometric illustration. 
Let's kick things off by writing about one of my favorite tools. 

Geometric illustration is a style that uses simple shapes and lines to create dynamic and visually striking compositions. This style is ideal for capturing complex concepts and ideas in a clear and concise way, making it a popular choice for infographics, technical drawings, and educational materials.

By using geometric shapes and line art, geometric illustrators are able to convey depth, movement, and texture through simple lines and forms. This style is also highly versatile, allowing illustrators to create detailed and intricate compositions that can be used in a variety of contexts, from advertising and marketing to scientific and technical publications.

Overall, geometric illustration is a powerful tool for visual communication, using simple shapes and lines to convey complex ideas and concepts in a way that is both visually appealing and easy to understand. 

## How does geometric illustration work? 

How exactly I use geometric illustrations varies, but I employ them for visualization(s) of both ideas, concepts, and actual data very frequently. For example, I often use a lot of pie charts. It can really slice some people the wrong way, but everyone else gets a nice piece of the idea to take away with them and enjoy later.
