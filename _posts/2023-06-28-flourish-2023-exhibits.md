# Flourish Art Festival, 2023. 

The first art exhibit of the year was a strange one for me. 

It was a group exhibition, and there's all of the usual feelings which accompany showcasing your artwork in front of a committee of strangers who are entrusting their innermost thoughts to a group of strangers who will become friends afterwards. 

It. Is. Hair-raising. 

I understand why half of these people are here. We're addicts. Sharing in a drug. We're all addicted to the euphoria of sharing ideas. Anyway, yes. 

As an artist, there is nothing quite like the feeling of seeing your work on display in a gallery setting. Earlier this month, I had the privilege of participating in a group exhibition that showcased a range of artistic mediums, from painting and drawing to photography and film.

For this exhibition, I showcased a painting, and a short film that explored themes of accessibility. The painting, titled "Synesthesium,".

The short film, co-directed by yours truly, was presented under the title 'A Journey of Light'. The resulting footage was edited into a short film that explored the subtle shifts in color and texture as the sun moved across the sky.

The response to my work was incredibly positive, with many visitors commenting on the sense of peace and tranquility that emanated from the paintings and the vivid sense of place that emerged from the film. It was an honor to be included in this exhibition alongside such talented artists, and I am grateful for the opportunity to share my work with a wider audience.

Overall, the success of this group exhibition reminds me of the power of art to connect us to one another and to the world around us. Through our creative expressions, we can explore complex themes and emotions, and invite others to join us on that journey. I am grateful to be a part of this community and look forward to continuing to create and share my work in the future.
