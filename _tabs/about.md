Hello. Welcome to the site. 

As a visual artist and illustrator, I am passionate about exploring the beauty in the everyday and capturing ideas through vibrant and colorful compositions. My work celebrates the mundane and the overlooked, transforming ordinary objects and scenes into something magical and inspiring.

My journey as an artist has taken me down many paths, from experimenting with different mediums and techniques to collaborating with other creatives and exhibiting my work. Through it all, I have learned that creativity is a process of discovery and exploration, and that the most important thing is to keep pushing boundaries and following your passion. 

I am also a skilled live scribe, using my illustration skills to capture ideas and concepts in real-time during events and workshops. This allows me to bring a visual element to discussions, and helps participants engage with conversations in a new and interactive way, discovering overlooked nuance along the way. 

> I hope you enjoy browsing through my portfolio and learning more about my journey as an artist and illustrator. Thank you for visiting!
